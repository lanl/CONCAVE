# CONCAVE
Convex Optimization for Numerical Computations Achieving Verifiable Estimates

## Installation

There are two ways to install and use this package. Both assume that Julia is
already present on the system.

Assuming that only the Julia package `CONCAVE` itself is desired, you can add
it to your Julia environment with
```
julia> Pkg.add("https://github.com/lanl/CONCAVE")
```

Alternatively, to download the full source in "development mode":
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lanl/CONCAVE
$ cd CONCAVE
$ julia
julia> Pkg.activate(".")
```
